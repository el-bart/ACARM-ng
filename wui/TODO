* correlation count for each filter type.
* add checking of data model version in WUI with proper warning displaying, if needed.
* add session mechanism to prevent CSRF in WUI.
* implement more filtering power to alerts - dynamic query mechnism (trac-like) would be nice.
* add "show meta-alerts with given alerts" button to alerts menu.
* fix (meta-)alert count statistics on the main screen - rounding is too rough so 1000000 and 1999999 are mapped to "1M".
