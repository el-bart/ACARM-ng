* create meta-alert overview, that would show all the meta-alerts' content (i.e.: children nodes) on one page.
* correlation count for each filter type.
* add checking of data model version in WUI with proper warning displaying, if needed.
* add session mechanism to prevent CSRF in WUI.
* implement more filtering power to alerts - dynamic query mechnism (trac-like) would be nice.
* add "show meta-alerts with given alerts" button to alerts menu.
