ID-1 all data is preserved in data base.
ID-2 system has a base framework where user-plugins can be provided:
  ID-2.1 filters plugins.
  ID-2.2 triggers plugins.
  ID-2.3 data inputs plugins.
ID-3 set-based alerts processing - alerts are never removed from input, only changed or newly correlated are added.
ID-4 each correlation makes alert life-time longer by a given time (plugins decide how long).
ID-5 set of correlated alerts creates forest structure.
ID-6 system must provide unified way of reading/setting configuration.
ID-7 each trigger has its own run-after treshold.
ID-8 alerts can be reported any time and still be correlated afterwards.
ID-9 unified way of handling triggers/filters states (FSM?), keept in data base.
ID-10 possibility to run triggers in separate processes.
ID-11 possibility to run filters in separate processes.
ID-12 data input from prelude-manager.
ID-13 hierarchical alerts - reporting high-level alerts prevents reporting of low-level alerts, included in it (prevents alarm flooding).
ID-14 ability to clean-up od data base entries (user-defined time threshold).
ID-19 common framework for adaptive parameters for plugins and triggers.
ID-20 automatic prioritazation of alerts (i.e. via filters: ID-2.1).
ID-21 wizualization of system work effects based on web technologies.


ID-15 alerts and corelation results are available to user via fuse: dates in directories, files for time. IDMEF format is to be used.
ID-16 AI module for correlating events that may indicate some new system activity.
ID-17 adaptive system for gathering administrator's feedback to system, which alerts are important and which are not.
ID-18 agents installed on monitored hosts to perform inside audit in case of doubt / more information were needed.
ID-22 system configuration via web-interface.
ID-23 extend IDS to be IPS via triggers (ID-2.2).
