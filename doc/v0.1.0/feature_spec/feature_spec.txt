ID-1 all data is preserved in data base.
ID-2 system has a base framework where user-plug-ins can be provided:
  ID-2.1 filter plug-ins.
  ID-2.2 trigger plug-ins.
  ID-2.3 data input plug-ins.
ID-3 set-based alerts processing - alerts are never removed from input, only changed or newly correlated are added.
ID-4 each correlation makes alert life-time longer by a given time (filter plug-ins decide how long).
ID-5 set of correlated alerts creates forest structure.
ID-6 system must provide unified way of reading/setting configuration.
ID-7 each trigger has its own threshold - when reached it is run.
ID-8 alerts can be reported to admin any time (asynchronous) and still be correlated afterwords (still in system set).
ID-9 unified way of handling triggers/filters states (FSM?), kept in data base.
ID-12 data input from prelude-manager.
ID-13 hierarchical alerts - reporting high-level alerts prevents reporting of low-level alerts, included in it (prevents alarm flooding).
ID-14 ability to clean-up old data base entries (user-defined time threshold).
ID-24 generic API for creating new filters, triggers and data inputs.
