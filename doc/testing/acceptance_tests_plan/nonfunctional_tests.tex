{nf-1}
{Basic throughput}
{Test maximal number of alerts that can be accepted by the system in a second (assuming that it will be removed straight away).}
{System is up and running, configured without any filters and triggers.}
{
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Start alerts generation}
\item{Measure number of alerts accepted in a given amount of time}
\end{enumerate}
}
{Minimum reasonable number of alerts on a single-core machine is 1000.}

\item{Start alerts generation}
\item{Measure number of alerts accepted in a given amount of time}
