-- dev --
* added pseudo-collection of all leafs to meta-alert's tree element, when accessed with string facade.
* added severity and certainty as a meta-alert's tree element, when accessed with string facade.
* algorithms dedicated for use in C++ are now more robust:
  - const and non-const versions are supported.
  - smart and raw pointers are supported as arguments.
* comparisons with regular expressions in preprocessor rules.
* support for SnortSam firewall reconfiguration tool (as a trigger).
* fixed compatibility issue with postgres 9.1 and previous releases.
* fixed condition for warning on data abse cleanup taking too long.
* added preprocessors for triggers.
* added heartbeats for external service (dshiled), when using ipblacklist filter.
* unified string-access between preprocessor and Python API - the same syntax is used now (except for the collections).
* Python interface for writing filters has been created.


-- v0.3.3 --
* fixed timezone in WUI, when DB server is not configured in UTC.


-- v0.3.2 --
* fixed "path too long" bug in string-access facade.


-- v0.3.1 --
* fixed dependency issue - release code does not include test headers.
* fixed compilation with icc (intel toolchain) on hosts with machine-dependent includes in /usr/include/<machine> implicit directory.


-- v0.3.x --
* Python interface for writing triggers has been created.
* added support for Python scripts (via Persistency::Facades::StrAccess and PythonAPI interfaces).
* Prado 3.1.9 introduced for WUI.
* added tests to configure script - now each requirement is tested, before delivery.
* clean-up in project's root directory.
* added heartbeats visualization to WUI.
* added logs of all actions in WUI (browsable via WUI).


-- v0.2.1 --
* data base version string fix.


-- v0.2.0 --
* separation of types representing processors' name and type (API update).
* fixed invalid handling of ECL in processors (aka: many-to-many ECL bug).
* documentation updates.
* simplified autotools-like compile and installation wrapper.
* new version of build process.
* added dedicated thread for signals handling (ensures no dead locks are possible when sending signals).
* main branch is now publicly available.
* filters:
  - new event
  - users monitor
  - content similarity
* icc support (intel toolchain).


-- v0.1.2 --
* fixed build for new version of libpqxx.


-- v0.1.1 --
* fixed issue with same-name filter not appending to correlated entry.


-- v0.1.0 --

* WUI (Web User Interface) for data visualization.
* all elements loadable as plugins.
* preprocessor for rejecting unwanted alerts.
* gcc support.
* multi-threaded processing.
* common algorithms for (meta-)alerts processing.
* flexible notification with triggers.
* flexible correlation and processing with filters.
* flexible data collection with inputs.
* flexible data storage with persistency modules.
* logging to:
  - file
  - screen
  - syslog
  - null (discards logs)
* removal of debug logs in release mode.
* filters:
  - one to one
  - many to one
  - one to many
  - many to many
  - event chain
  - DNS resolver
  - IP blacklist
  - same name
* inputs:
  - prelude
  - file (IDMEF)
* triggers:
  - gadu-gadu
  - e-mail
  - jabber
  - file output (IDMEF)
  - external application
* persistency modules:
  - postgres
  - stub (no persistent storage)
* application to dump alerts from persistent storage.
* WUI options:
  - access to alerts
  - access to correlated alerts (aka: meta-alerts)
  - access to analyzers
  - heat map
  - alerts count in time plot
  - meta alerts count in time plot
  - alerts types plot
