There used to be script for parsing logs called 'split_to_threads', but
it was not efficient enough for huge files with many threads. Therefore
it has been replaced with 'logsplitter' application written in C++.
It is automatically build as a separate application. It reads data from
stdin and writes logs, split to threads to files 'thread_N.log', in current
directory.
