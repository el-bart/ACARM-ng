Script for parsing logs is called 'split_to_threads'. It is not efficient
enough for huge files with many threads, though. Therefore it has been
replaced with 'logsplitter' application written in C++. It is automatically
build as a separate application. It reads data from stdin and writes logs,
split to threads to files 'thread_N.log', in current directory.

Note that script has been left out for backward compatibility, though it is
not recommended to be used. It may be removed in the future.
