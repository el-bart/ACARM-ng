2 rereading configuration from file (note: not all configuration may change at runtime).
8 refactor ConfigIO - it should read configuration file and keep it in memory. proper handles for specific parts of configuration file should be implemented by interested components.
9 think what can be done about libprelude's GPL license (others are commercial) - move it to separate process or buy LGPG/BSD?
11 think how to overcome lack of additional data assigned for observed graph nodes in filters during normal run - they will not be present after reading from persistency.
15 update Persistency::Postgres::Restorer to use set<> internally instead of vector and so remove duplicates on-the-fly, then copy response to output vector.
17 GraphNode (MetaAlert?) should have some unique identifier in the system, that can be reported.
26 create XML schema for config file.
27 add parse-at-read feature to configio - config should be accepted or rejected when running application, not delayed until acctuall usage (note: this task is connected with config's refactoring to register parsers).
30 trigger for ICQ or jabber messages.
32 add names to inputs, so that multiple instances of the same input types are possible.
37 add extra check while running ACARM-ng, if last run finished successfully or not (ex.: via DynamicConfig entry, changed uppon normal exit).
38 consider running persistency cleanup in a separate thread - it takes a lot of time... it could be also run in background onec a day by system, to ensure quick starting of acarm.
39 consider some sort of mechanism to prevent crashes when connection lives shorter than transaction (ex.: keeping connection in transaction?).
40 fix TODOs in QueueRestorer - structure is broken now...
41 consider adding 'descrioption' to meta-alert to reflect extra correlation pieces of information (like details on what bases these alerts have been correlated).
46 if filters' prerequisites are not enought consider adding userd-defined rules in config file as well.
51 ipblackfilter does not save paramters in data base - after restart the same alerts will get severity incremetned once more; soncider saving MetaAlertID->done/notdone as a config paramter.
