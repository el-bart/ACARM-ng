1 adding modified nodes to queue should be unique (i.e. there is no sense in repeating entries to process). consider creating Base::UniqueFifoQueue.
2 rereading configuration from file (note: not all configuration may change).
3 rework configuration layout for persistency, so that type would be placed other way. consider: <persistency><type1/><type2/><use>type2</use></persistency>.
5 think how to remove timeout in daemon/input/Input/Thread.cpp
6 think about removing logger's entries from data base - is it really needed?
8 refactor ConfigIO - it should read configuration file and keep it in memory. proper handlers for specific parts of configuration file should be implemented by interested components.
