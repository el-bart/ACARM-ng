2 rereading configuration from file (note: not all configuration may change at runtime).
3 rework configuration layout for persistency, so that type would be placed other way. consider: <persistency><type1/><type2/><use>type2</use></persistency>.
5 think how to remove timeout in daemon/input/Input/Thread.cpp
6 think about removing logger's entries from data base - is it really needed?
8 refactor ConfigIO - it should read configuration file and keep it in memory. proper handlers for specific parts of configuration file should be implemented by interested components.
9 think what can be done about libprelude's GPL license (others are commercial) - move it to separate process or buy LGPG/BSD?
11 think how to overcome lack of additional data assigned for observed graph nodes in filters during normal run - they will not be present after reading from persistency.
15 update Persistency::Postgres::Restorer to use set<> internally instead of vector and so remove duplicates on-the-fly, then copy response to output vector.
17 GraphNode (MetaAlert?) should have some unique identifier in the system, that can be reported.
20 make logger's file names less verbose (component path is present in log-path any way).
21 separate GG and e-mail test account's config into separate file, with proper defines/constants so that there will be just one place to remove them from code before the release.
24 make formatting trigger's output separate namespace within Trigger, to reuse code.
25 add messages buffering before doing actuall send in triggers - this will prevent message lost, when server is temporary not available; note: buffering can be done at least in memory; buffering shall be done on trigger's API level.
26 create XML schema for config file.
27 add parse-at-read feature to configio - config should be accepted or rejected when running application, not delayed until acctuall usage (note: this task is connected with config's refactoring to register parsers).
28 add safety precaution not to allow running software as root.
29 add timestamps to triggered reports (to know when it has been triggered).
