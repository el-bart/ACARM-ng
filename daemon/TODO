2 rereading configuration from file (note: not all configuration may change at runtime).
3 rework configuration layout for persistency, so that type would be placed other way. consider: <persistency><type1/><type2/><use>type2</use></persistency>.
5 think how to remove timeout in daemon/input/Input/Thread.cpp
6 think about removing logger's entries from data base - is it really needed?
8 refactor ConfigIO - it should read configuration file and keep it in memory. proper handlers for specific parts of configuration file should be implemented by interested components.
9 think what can be done about libprelude's GPL license (others are commercial) - move it to separate process or buy LGPG/BSD?
11 think how to overcome lack of additional data assigned for observed graph nodes in filters during normal run - they will not be present after reading from persistency.
15 update Persistency::Postgres::Restorer to use set<> internally instead of vector and so remove duplicates on-the-fly, then copy response to output vector.
17 GraphNode (MetaAlert?) should have some unique identifier in the system, that can be reported.
