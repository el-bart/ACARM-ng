LibIDMEF version 1.0.0
======================

Author: Adam C. Migus <adam@migus.org>

Description
===========

Operation
=========

LibIDMEF is a C programming language developement library which uses the GNOME
libxml2 (http://xmlsoft.org) library to implement IDMEF message creation and
parsing.

Applications using LibIDMEF can either dynamically or statically link against
LibIDMEF using mechanisms common to most C programming language development
libraries.

Usage
=====

LibIDMEF offers two popular mechanisms to help developers with it's usage.
They are `pkgconfig' and the `libidmef-config' script.  For more information
on usage of pkgconfig please refer to the pkgconfig documentation
(http://www.gnu.org/pkgconfig/).

The libidmef-config script which installs with the distribution in
${prefix}/bin provides the C compiler flags $(CFLAGS) and C compiler linker
flags $(LDFLAGS) with the `--cflags' and `--libs' options respectively.

IDMEF Messages are XML documents and as such have a corresponding DTD.
For convenience LibIDMEF installs the IDMEF Message DTD and creates a
`#define' in idmef_global.h which contains it's location.  Also, during
message creation the path to the DTD is given in the IDMEF Message output
automatically.

For individual function usage please refer to the Application Programming
Interface (API) documentation.

Requirements
============

LibIDMEF requires GNOME libxml2 to both create and parse IDMEF messages.
Please refer to the GNOME libxml2 documentation for more information on
installation and configuration of libxml2.

Installation
============

See the INSTALL file in this distribution.
