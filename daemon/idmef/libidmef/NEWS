03-01-2002 - Finished final upgrades to IDMEF 0.7.  Release as libidmef 0.7.1

01-18-2002 - Removed the libntp dependency.

11-08-2001 - Lots of stuff has been updated over the past few months, but nothing worth mentioning specifically other than the addition of IDMEF parsing code contributions from Adam Migus of NAI.  Adam is now a co-author of libidmef.  Libidmef is compliant with the IDMEF spec version 0.4, which may be the one sent to IESG for RFC submission.

3-30-2001 - I have been in the process of updating libidmef to comply with the latest release of the IDMEF spec. I am currently updating the API and the library itself. When that is completed, I will update the rest of the documentation accordingly. The next release should be in early May. 

1-2-2001 - Libidmef is now released under the GNU GPL and BSD style licenses.  This should accomodate the needs of commercial developers. Libidmef can be used under the GPL or BSD license, but not both. If there are licensing issues, please let me know. 

Compatibility issues with libidmef and the latest version of libxml2 2.2.10 seem to have been limited to an isolated incident . I tested on Red Hat Linux 6.1, and OpenBSD 2.6. Both passed with flying colors. Please let me know if you find compatiblity problems with your platform.
