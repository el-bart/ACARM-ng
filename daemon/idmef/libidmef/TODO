IDMEF XML Library version 1.0.x

The TODO list
--------------

- The DTD requires some elements to be in a specific order under a parent in
  the XML tree.  The current functions do not sort the parameters, so if they
  are passed in out of order, errors will occur during validation.  This is
  probably something that should be handled at this library's level.

- Add functions to read messages from a file, socket, or memory location.

- Add a parameter to the Time functions to specify the format of the NTP
  Timestamp.  Right now, the format used is YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
  
- (sp) Implement namespace support
